# for python 3
name = input("name: ")
age = int(input("age: "))
print("hello {} your age is {}".format(name,age))
# for latest version python
print(f"hello {name} your age is {age} ")
#great thing about formatted strings is you don't have to worry about writing or combining strings and numbers together
